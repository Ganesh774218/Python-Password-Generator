# Python-Password-Generator
Overview - 
The Python Password Generator is a script that creates secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria.
The project demonstrates programming concepts such as randomization, string manipulation, user input handling, and security best practices.

Description - 
This project involves the development of a secure and customizable password generator using Python. The application allows users to generate strong, random passwords based on criteria such as the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It leverages Python's built-in libraries like random and string to ensure password diversity and strength.

Objectives - 
To automate the creation of secure, unpredictable passwords.
To allow users to customize the composition of the password.
To improve awareness and ease of creating secure credentials.

Tools Used - 
Programming Language: Python
Environment: Jupyter Notebook/Lab
Libraries:random module â€” for random character selection.


Features & Functionality
âœ… Random Password Generation - 
ðŸ”¹ Generates passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
ðŸ”¹ Allows customization of password length for varying security levels.
âœ… Security Measures
ðŸ”¹ Uses randomization techniques to enhance unpredictability.
ðŸ”¹ Includes special characters to strengthen password security.
ðŸ”¹ Can implement encryption or hashing for storing passwords securely.
âœ… User-Friendly Options
ðŸ”¹ Accepts user preferences (length, character types).
ðŸ”¹ Displays passwords clearly for easy copying.
ðŸ”¹ Can integrate with GUI interfaces for a better user experience.

Conclusion - 
This password generator successfully achieves the goal of generating customizable, secure passwords. It demonstrates foundational Python skills including control structures, list operations, and randomization. It is a practical mini-project for learning and can be expanded into a larger application with storage and security features.
